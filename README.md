# Automated-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3
This project is a modified version of source https://colab.research.google.com/github/zzh8829/yolov3-tf2/blob/master/colab_gpu.ipynb  For object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.  And also to to use a pre-trained model and fine tune it on new data.
